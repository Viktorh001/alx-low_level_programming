This is a project on bit manipulation.
bit mal is all about taking control over the bytes of a machine through logic operators and binary values.
The sumary of this project is as follows

Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
Write a function that checks the endianness.
